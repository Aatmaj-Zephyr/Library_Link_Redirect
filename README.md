### Extension to redirect to Library Remotex Portal

Many students are struggling to access IEEE and ACM papers from Somaiya University. This is because the login process is very tedious. In order to avoid this, I have made a one click extension to redirect to Library Remotex portal.

### How to use the extension?

1. Download the src folder of this repository.
2. Go to chrome://extensions/
3. Turn on Developer Tools mode ðŸš€
4. Click on Load Unpacked
5. Upload the src folder.
6. Go to any IEEE or ACM paper. 
7. Click on the extension. Login with Somaiya Mail if prompted.
8. You will now be able to access the paper through the institution.âœ¨ðŸŒŸ



You can test the extension:

1. Go to https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10392776
2. Click on the extension & login.
3. URL now changes to https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.library.somaiya.edu/document/10392776.
